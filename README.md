Performing analysis on Green Stocks using VBA - Module 2
## Overview of Project: 
Exploring green energy stock performance by analyzing financial data using VBA in Excel.
### Purpose
Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is the purpose of creating macro and the fundamentals of coding. VBA provides essentially infinite extensibility to Excel. Using code to automate routine tasks decreases the chance of errors and reduces the time needed to run analyses.
 The analysis consists of the following tasks:
  •	Create a VBA macro that can trigger pop-ups and inputs, read and change cell values, and format cells.
  •	Use for loops and conditionals to direct logic flow.
  •	Use nested for loops.
  •	Apply coding skills such as syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.
The first part was to create a workbook that analyzed the entire dataset, that was easy for Steve to analyze.  
The second part was create a workbook that refactored the workbook to make the code run faster.

# Summary: 
The results were that the in 2017 and 2018 Stocks ENPH and RUN consistently performed well and yielded a profit. This was advantageous to Tom’s portfolio for his parents.  The stock TERP did not do well in both years and was consistently negative in both years.  If I were to advise Tom, I would suggest dropping the stock and replacing with one that was much more profitable.
## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantage of refactoring code to increase performance and efficiency. Saves time and optimizes results.  
The code does not need to be written as an original.  Most of the work has been done, the disadvantage of that is that it is difficult to figure out where the errors are, and to troubleshoot the error.  There can be multiple documents and it is hard to keep track which one ran smoothly.  
## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The pros are to refactoring the original VBA script is that the run time to go through the complex and organized entire script was less and results were given quickly.  Quicker results give decision makers the spontaneous decisions on the spot, as sometimes timing is of the essence.
The downside of refactoring the original VBA, is that it is extremely important to be highly detail oriented and organized.  It is important to complete the work in one go if possible, because if left alone, it is extremely difficult where the errors or syntax could be.
